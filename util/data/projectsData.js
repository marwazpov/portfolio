        text:"Containing 5 responsive pages as well as a user profile, 'Jobie' was the culmination of work of a 17-membered team and I during our capstone phase during Re:Coded's front-end development bootcamp. As it was my first time working on a tech project with a big team, I have learnt valuable lessons. I was able to particpate on all phases of the project contributing to project's set up, design and functionality as well as bug-bashing. We used multiple frameworks and libraries including: react, redux-tool kit, i18next, firebase,tailwind,jest,toastify, yup, and react-icons.",
